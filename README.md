# *SHOOT THE TARGETS*

## Things to consider:

This was my first game using the `pygame`, now I'm refactoring it to make it better.

The idea of this project is to create a simple game from start
to finish. This means having a ***title screen***, a gameplay with a ***score*** and a ***game over*** system, and the option to ***restart*** or ***quit*** the game. 

In addition to that, this is meant to be an exercise for programming in `Python` and learning how to use `pygame`.

## The game concept:
You move a gun reticle across the screen to aim and shoot moving targets. The targets will move from left to right, and if they go beyond the screen bounds, the player loses 1 life out a total of 3.
If the player shoots a target, he scores 1 point. If the player runs out of lives, it's game over and can replay the game or quit as wished.
