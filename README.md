# *SHOOT THE TARGETS*

## Things to consider:

This is my first game using the `pygame` library (i've made games before, mostly unfinished ones).

The idea of this project is to create a simple game from start
to finish. This means having a ***title screen***, a gameplay with a ***score*** and a ***game over*** system, and the option to ***restart*** or ***quit*** the game. 

In addition to that, this is meant to be an exercise for programming in `Python` and learning how to use `pygame`. The _documentation.md_ file is a sort of a ***learning journal*** intended to record what i think are the most important aspects of the `library` as i'm learning to use it, So in the future if a forget something, i can go back to this file and easy look what i've done before. Writing a file like this one is actually a good way to refresh the contents you've been learning so far.

## The game itself:
You move a gun reticle across the screen to aim and shoot moving targets. The targets will move from left to right, and if they go beyond the screen limits, the player loses 1 life out a total of 3.
If the player shoots a target, he/she scores 1 point. If the player runs out of lives, it's game over and can replay the game or quit as wished.
